# The Guide to Linux

# What is Linux?
it's not really an OS, rather an open-source Kernel from which its Oses are made. So why do people say "Switch to Linux"? well since all use the same kernel they come under one heading. Now when you google Linux it will tell you that it has 600 distros under it. But that's just so Wrong! there are only something Like 20 that are avaiable for download and that actually function.

# What's a Kernel?
It's the base software used to make an OS. Microsoft and MacOS kernels are closed-source meaning they control it. But That's not the case with the Linux Kernel, it's completely free and open source, though you have to prove your skills to the "Linux Foundation"
